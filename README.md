In this folder, you will see a folder named “source_code” which contains the project’s source code. Inside this folder, there is a folder named “text-categorization-with-vsm”. In this directory, you should build the project via maven with the following command:
‘mvn clean package’

After running this command, you will see a jar named “data.mining.project-v1.0.jar” under a newly created folder “target”. You can run this jar file via this command:
‘java -jar data.mining.project-v1.0.jar /Path/to/Parent/Directory/Of/Documents’ where /Path/to/Parent/Directory/Of/Documents variable represents the parent directory of the dataset i.e. “java -jar data.mining.project-v1.0.jar /Users/Downloads/20news-bydate/”.
